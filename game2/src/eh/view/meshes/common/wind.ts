// Wind sway for instanced vegetation (grass tufts, trees), as a vertex
// shader patch. Each vertex is pushed along the wind by an amount growing
// with the square of its height, so roots stay planted and tops sway. The
// phase comes from the instance's world position, so a gust visibly
// ripples across the map instead of everything moving in lockstep. The
// wind blows the same world direction for every instance, whatever its
// quarter-turn rotation. Displacement depends only on a vertex's position,
// so voxel faces sharing a corner stay joined, with no cracks.
//
// The options are baked into the GLSL, so each set gets its own program
// cache key: three.js reuses compiled programs by key, and the default key
// (this patch function's source) is identical for grass, trees and bushes,
// which would otherwise all render with whichever compiled first.
//
// Vegetation can also part around the hero as they walk through it (`push`):
// each instance within its radius of them (by its own position, so it moves
// as one piece, like the wind, and its voxels don't warp) leans away and
// sinks, the tops most.
